# Rails Static

_Generate static sites with Rails · a step by step guide_

### Another framework?

The Ruby ecosystem offers many static site generators - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), [Kamal Skiff](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal-skiff), [Sitepress](https://sitepress.cc), [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/), [High Voltage](https://thoughtbot.github.io/high_voltage), [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app), ... - and countless more exist beyond Ruby.

The intent here is **to remove one** - to use Rails and all its magic goodies for both dynamic and static sites.

This is not a new framework. It's a thoughtful collection of existing gems that each excel at one task and integrate seamlessly with Rails.
